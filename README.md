# ROCC Accelerator to Compute the Determinant of a Tridiagonal Matrix

This relies on the Chipyard frameowrk and its standard cores, please refer to their documentation for more information [here](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Information about Tridiagonal matrices can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridiagonal_matrix) and symmetric or Hermitian matrces can be converted to Tridiagonal form using the [Lanczos Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm).
